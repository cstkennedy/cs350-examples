## Java 1

This is part of a collection of short (20 to 30) minute Java discussions. The focus of
these examples and discussions is to provide an overview of Java. 

  * Example 1 - An example of reading keyboard input using the Java `Scanner`
    class.
  * Example 2 - An example in which the Fibonacci Sequence is computed. This
    example includes C++ and Java examples. Note the Python 3 example is
    included for comparison. You will not be tested on Python.
  * Example 3 - An example of a CS 250 level Objected Oriented Program in Java
    (instead of C++).

    - This includes a brief discussion of Gradle and JUnit as topics of
      interest.
    - Gradle and JUnit are topics that we will discuss later in CS 350.
      - If you are truly curious you can jump ahead to the JUnit, Gradle and
        JUnit-2 reviews.

Part 1 of the discussion (Examples 1 and 2) is available
[here](https://youtu.be/tpB1wh5pt5Y) and Part 2 (Example 3) is available
