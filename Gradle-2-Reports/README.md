# Gradle Report Generation

In the previous Gradle [lectures/examples](../Gradle-1) we discussed setting up
a Gradle project for Java with JUnit, Jacoco, Spotbugs, PMD, and Checkstyle.

This time around, we will work on setting up a more **friendly** set of
reports... complete with a landing bage (using JBake).


  - **Example 0** covers the files we will need to add for JBake
  - **Example 1** covers a basic `deploy task` and dependencies. A quick
    addition of the `project-report` plugin is included.
