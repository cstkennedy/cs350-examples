This is a recorded review of extending a basic _Gradle_ build file for a Java
application. The discussion covered 3 examples:

  - _Example 1_ - Add FindBugs, PMD, Jacoco, and Javadoc
     to a Gradle build.
  - _Example 2_ - Add Checkstyle to the Example 1 Gradle build.
  - _Example 3_ - Discuss the corrections made based on the
    Example 2 Checkstyle report
